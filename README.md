# IEEE-Advanced-Projects-2017-2018

This is the collective work done by myself, Will Fehrnstrom, Ryan Nemiroff, and Amit Golan as part of the Advanced Projects project groups
at UCLA IEEE. 

The objective was the build a fully functioning quadcopter which entails designing the PCB using Eagle Cad and coding much of the
wireless connections and motor control using a MPU6050 and microprocessors(arduino).
